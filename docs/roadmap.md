# Faye Roadmap

This roadmap stays practical and open-source friendly.

## V1.2 Priorities

1. Listener flow reliability: reduce missed first-response cases.
2. Better diagnostics: clearer runtime health in dashboard.
3. Installer distribution: one-command bootstrap + release docs.
4. Trust and safety docs: privacy, threat model, security policy.
5. Community rails: contribution templates and maintainer guides.

## V1.3 Candidate Work

1. Optional non-Telegram local command transport.
2. Export/import profile packs.
3. Dashboard logs viewer with redaction.
4. Multi-device speaker routing presets.

## Not in Scope (Near Term)

1. Billing or subscription infrastructure.
2. Cloud multi-tenant control plane.
3. Public internet control endpoints by default.
