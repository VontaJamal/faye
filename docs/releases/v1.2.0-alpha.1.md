# Faye v1.2.0-alpha.1

Release date: 2026-02-20

This alpha focuses on reliability, install simplicity, and maintainer governance.

## Highlights

1. Bridge runtime telemetry is visible in API and dashboard status panels.
2. Telegram bridge command handling is more resilient with better replay safety.
3. One-command bootstrap install is available for new users.
4. Trust and safety baseline docs are now first-class (`SECURITY.md`, privacy, threat model).
5. Seven Shadow doctrine now includes scheduled canary and security pattern checks.

## Alpha Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VontaJamal/faye/main/scripts/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

## Verification Commands

```bash
npm run build
npm test
npm run canary
./scripts/seven-shadow-test.sh 2
npm audit --audit-level=high
```

## Known Alpha Constraints

1. End-to-end conversational timing still depends on Telegram/OpenClaw response timing.
2. Real reboot/login behavior must be validated per machine setup.
